  "purposedescription": "Our goal in creating zVods is to help the community by preserving the complete content. We noticed that usually only edited videos, short clips, or screenshots of live streams are saved, so we decided to create a platform to save live broadcasts and also the energy provided by the chat. We have no limits for project creation. Our objectives include allowing anyone to post their content on zVods; our idea is simply to expand.",
  "profitstitle": "Profits",
  "profitsdescription": "Like any company, zVods was also created with the thought that it will one day become profitable. However, we do not aim to be predatory in this. We do not want to disrupt the user experience, as we are also users of platforms. Therefore, we have no plans to fill the user's screen with ads and pop-ups to profit from views. Every business has its time, and we make zVods because we enjoy it, not because we want to get rich.",
  "teamtitle": "Team",
  "teamdescription": "At all times, we need team members. Currently, we are expanding the project like never before, creating new programs such as the recorder and our content editing studio, and for that, we need people who are eager to grow. If you are one of those people, get in touch with us; we are interested in having you on our team.",
  "futuretitle": "Future",
  "futuredescription": "As a community project, we are interested in expanding to more and more communities. For this, your recommendation of our service on other channels, your donations, and your frequent visits to the site are important. We greatly appreciate the community for all the support since the project's launch. What to expect from zVods? Well, no one can predict the future, but we will try to make life easier for the end user, who always wants to see a live stream and chat from their favorite content creator. Interested in the project? Get in touch, donate, participate! Welcome to zVods!",
